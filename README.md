### Simple Vue.js List

For this exercise, you will need to build a simple Vue.js app to list the
given quotes. Please do not use any libraries or plugins to do this other
than the core [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and, optionally, a library to fetch
the quotes.

You can assume that you only need to support modern web browsers, so feel
free to build the app using either the new ECMAScript 6 or the older ECMAScript 5
("plain" JavaScript) standard.

Please provide the following functionality:

 * Required: Fetch quotes from the source [quotes.json](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/benchprep/dffc3bffa9704626aa8832a3b4de5b27/raw/quotes.json) and display the available information in a list-like structure (table/list)
 * Required: Provide client-side pagination (up to 15 quotes per page)
 * Required: Provide a way to filter between game and movie quotes
 * Required: Provide a client-side search that filters by the quote text
